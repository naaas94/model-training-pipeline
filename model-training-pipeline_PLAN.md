# Model Training Pipeline: Detailed Implementation Plan

**Project Type:** Modular ML Model Training Pipeline  
**Stack:** Python • Scikit-learn • Pandas • MLflow (optional)  
**Purpose:** Reproducible, auditable, and scalable training of privacy intent classification models for integration with the PCC system.

---

## Overview

This project implements a robust, production-oriented pipeline for training and versioning ML models for privacy intent classification. The pipeline is designed to consume curated datasets generated by the data-pipeline, perform systematic training, evaluation, and artifact management, and output versioned models ready for deployment in the PCC inference layer.

---

## Key Learnings & Tensions

- **Data Scarcity:** Unlike enterprise settings (e.g., Spotify), labeled data is limited. The pipeline must support both simulated and real datasets, and document all assumptions.
- **Curated Data:** The quality of the training set is critical. Automated validation, balancing, and stratified sampling are required, but the plan must allow for manual curation or review if needed.
- **Reproducibility vs. Flexibility:** All steps must be deterministic and logged, but the pipeline should allow for easy adjustment of sampling, balancing, and feature selection strategies.
- **Integration:** The pipeline must be decoupled but interoperable with the data-pipeline (for data ingestion) and PCC (for model deployment).

```

### 2. Data Ingestion

- **Input:** `/data/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet` (exported from data-pipeline).
- **Validation:**
  - Check schema: required columns (e.g., embeddings, label, metadata).
  - Assert no missing values in critical fields.
  - Log dataset version, provenance, and summary statistics.
- **Tension:** If the dataset is simulated, log all generation parameters for traceability.

---

### 3. Preprocessing

- **Feature Handling:**
  - Extract features (e.g., embeddings) and target variable.
  - Support for additional features (metadata, synthetic fields).
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and type mismatches.
  - Optionally, allow for manual review of edge cases.
- **Flexibility:** All preprocessing steps should be parameterizable via config or CLI.

---

### 4. Data Splitting & Sampling

- **Stratified Split:** Use `train_test_split(..., stratify=...)` to maintain class balance.
- **Control Groups:** If required, create and log a control group for evaluation.
- **Tension:** If the dataset is small, allow for k-fold cross-validation as an alternative.

---

### 5. Model Training

- **Baseline Model:** LogisticRegression (with hyperparameters from config).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV or similar, with cross-validation.
- **Metrics:** Track accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and confusion matrix.
- **Experiment Tracking:** (Optional) Integrate MLflow for parameter, metric, and artifact logging.
- **Reproducibility:** Set random seeds and log all parameters.

---

### 6. Evaluation

- **Test Set Evaluation:** Generate classification report, confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves.
- **Reporting:** Save all evaluation artifacts (plots, reports) to `/src/models/` or `/reports/`.
- **Tension:** If performance is poor, log warnings and suggest reviewing data curation or feature engineering.

---

### 7. Model Persistence

- **Serialization:** Save model as `.pkl` or `.joblib` in `/src/models/`.
- **Metadata:** Save a JSON with:
  - Model version, training date, data version/hash, hyperparameters, metrics, notes.
- **Versioning:** Use timestamp or semantic versioning for model files.

---

### 8. Documentation & Reproducibility

- **README.md:** Must include:
  - Project purpose and architecture
  - Usage instructions (CLI, config)
  - Integration points with data-pipeline and PCC
  - Example commands and expected outputs
  - Explicit notes on simulated vs. real data, and manual vs. automated curation
- **Assumptions & Limitations:** Clearly document any manual steps or data limitations.

---

### 9. Testing & Validation

- **Unit Tests:** For data loading, preprocessing, and model training.
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end test with a sample dataset.
- **Schema Validation:** Ensure compatibility with evolving data schemas and PCC requirements.

---

## Example CLI Usage

```bash
# Train with default config
python src/train_pipeline.py --data data/curated_training_data.csv

# Train with custom config
python src/train_pipeline.py --data data/curated_training_data.csv --config config.yaml
```

---

## Integration with PCC Ecosystem

- **Input:** Curated training dataset from data-pipeline (`/data/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`).
- **Output:** Versioned model artifact and metadata for deployment in PCC.
- **Traceability:** All training runs are logged with data and parameter provenance.

---

## Design Principles

- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic training, versioned data and models.
- **Auditability:** Transparent logging of all steps and metrics.
- **Modularity:** Decoupled components for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Production-Readiness:** Artifacts and reports suitable for real-world deployment and monitoring.
